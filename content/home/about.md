# Biography

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher in the lab of Chris Wheat, on a project involving wing color evolution in butterflies.

Previously, I was a PhD student with Niclas Kolm studying the function and evolution of brain size. For my thesis I performed experiments on brain size in guppies, and performed comparitive analyses on the same topic.

Later this year I will move to the University of British Colombia to work with Judith Mank.
