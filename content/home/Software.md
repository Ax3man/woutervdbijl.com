See my [GitHub profile](https://www.github.com/Ax3man) for my publicly available code.

In particular:

- I develop and maintain the [`phylopath` package](https://Ax3man.github.io/phylopath) for phylogenetic path analysis.
- I'm somewhat active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4341440/axeman).
