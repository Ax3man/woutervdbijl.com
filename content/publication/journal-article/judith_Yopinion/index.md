abstract: Recent methodological approaches have expanded our understanding of Y chromosome sequence, revealed unexpected Y diversity, and sparked a growing realization of its importance in evolutionary processes. To fully understand the diversity and importance of the Y chromosome, we suggest the need to move from a holotype Y chromosome sequence, based on a single individual and meant to represent the species, to a thorough understanding of Y chromosome haplotype diversity, its phenotypic implications, and its phylogeographic distribution. Additionally, the Y chromosome may play an important role in two key rules of speciation that have otherwise been attributed to the X, namely Haldaneâ€™s Rule and the Large-X Effect. Emerging genomic tools and analytical approaches are just now giving us the means to ask how important this small, often forgotten region of the genome is in evolutionary processes.
