bio: I study the evolution of complex traits, such as color patterns, brains and behavior. To that end, I use sequencing, quantative genetics, and large data approaches.

I study the evolution of complex traits, such as color patterns, brains and behavior. To that end, I combine large-scale phenotypic and genetic datasets with methodological advances, such as machine learning and statistical modelling.

I am currently working as a Research Associate in the lab of Judith Mank, at UBC. My current work focuses on the evolution and genetic basis of the highly variable color patterns of the Trinidadian Guppy.

Previously, I worked in the lab of Chris Wheat on butterfly coloration. Before that, I was a PhD student with Niclas Kolm studying the function and evolution of brain size. For my thesis I performed experiments on brain size in guppies, and performed comparative analyses on the same topic.
