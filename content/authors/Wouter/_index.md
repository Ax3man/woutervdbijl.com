bio: I study the evolution of complex traits, such as color patterns, brains and behavior. To that end, I use sequencing, quantative genetics, and large data approaches.

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher in the lab of Judith Mank, at UBC. My current work mainly involves the highly variable color patterns of the Trinidadian Guppy.

Previously, I worked in the lab of Chris Wheat on butterfly coloration. Before that, I was a PhD student with Niclas Kolm studying the function and evolution of brain size. For my thesis I performed experiments on brain size in guppies, and performed comparative analyses on the same topic.
