bio: I study the evolution of complex traits, such as color patterns, brains and behavior. To that end, I use sequencing, quantative genetics, and large data approaches.

I am currently working as a Research Associate in the lab of Judith Mank, at UBC. I study the evolution of traits using large datasets and computational approaches. My current work focuses on the inheritance and genetic basis of the highly variable color patterns of the Trinidadian Guppy.

Previously, I worked in the lab of Chris Wheat on butterfly coloration. Before that, I was a PhD student with Niclas Kolm studying the function and evolution of brain size. For my thesis I performed experiments on brain size in guppies, and performed comparative analyses on the same topic.
